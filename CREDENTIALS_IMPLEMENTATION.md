# API Key Credentials Management Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a complete API key credentials management system for your Monday.com integration app, allowing users to securely store and manage API keys for third-party services. This system has been cleaned of all GitHub-specific code and focuses solely on third-party API key management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Clean Architecture**

- ‚úÖ Removed all GitHub-specific code and dependencies
- ‚úÖ Simplified the codebase to focus only on API key management
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up imports and removed unused services
- ‚úÖ Updated package.json to remove GitHub-related dependencies

### 2. **API Key Management**

- ‚úÖ Implemented proper `getApiKeyStatus` endpoint that returns masked keys
- ‚úÖ Enhanced `saveApiKey` to use the connection model service
- ‚úÖ Fixed `deleteApiKey` to properly remove only the API key
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 3. **Connection Model Service**

- ‚úÖ Simplified to handle only API keys (removed OAuth token handling)
- ‚úÖ Updated documentation and type definitions
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and logging

### 4. **User Interface**

- ‚úÖ Completely redesigned the authorization page with modern UI
- ‚úÖ Added support for displaying existing API keys (masked)
- ‚úÖ Implemented delete functionality with confirmation
- ‚úÖ Added real-time status messages and error handling
- ‚úÖ Made the interface responsive and user-friendly

### 5. **Code Cleanup**

- ‚úÖ Removed GitHub OAuth flows and related controllers
- ‚úÖ Deleted GitHub-specific services and constants
- ‚úÖ Cleaned up routes to only include API key management
- ‚úÖ Updated project name and documentation

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint            | Method | Purpose              | Authentication |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------------- |
| `/get-api-key`      | GET    | Check API key status | Required       |
| `/monday/authorize` | GET    | Show API key form    | Required       |
| `/save-api-key`     | POST   | Save new API key     | Required       |
| `/delete-api-key`   | POST   | Delete API key       | Required       |

## Response Formats

### GET `/get-api-key`

```json
// When API key exists
{
  "connected": true,
  "maskedKey": "test‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢1234"
}

// When no API key exists
{
  "message": "API Key not found."
}
```

### POST `/save-api-key`

```json
// Success
"<script>window.close();</script>"

// Error
{
  "message": "API key is required."
}
```

### POST `/delete-api-key`

```json
// Success
{
  "message": "API Key deleted successfully"
}

// Error
{
  "message": "Internal Server Error"
}
```

## Monday.com Field Type Configuration

### Required Settings in Developer Center:

1. **Field Type Configuration**:

   - **Credentials URL**: `/get-api-key`
   - **Authorization URL**: `https://your-domain.com/monday/authorize`
   - **Delete Credentials URL**: `/delete-api-key`

2. **Credential Parameters**:
   - **Name**: `apiKey`
   - **Title**: "Third-Party API Key"
   - **Type**: `string`
   - **Required**: `true`

## Testing

### 1. **Local Testing**

```bash
# Start your development server
npm run dev

# Run the test script
node test-credentials-endpoints.js http://localhost:8080
```

### 2. **Production Testing**

1. Deploy your application
2. Update the Authorization URL in Monday.com Developer Center
3. Test the complete flow in Monday.com
4. Monitor logs for any issues

## Security Considerations

### ‚úÖ **Implemented Security Measures**

- API keys are stored in Monday.com's secure storage
- All endpoints require authentication via JWT
- API keys are masked when displayed to users
- No sensitive data is logged
- Input validation on all endpoints

### üîí **Best Practices**

- Always use HTTPS in production
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Implement rate limiting if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Failed to load user credentials"**

   - Check that `/get-api-key` endpoint returns correct status codes
   - Verify authentication middleware is working
   - Check server logs for errors

2. **Authorization page not loading**

   - Verify Authorization URL is publicly accessible
   - Check that `/monday/authorize` endpoint exists
   - Ensure domain is properly configured

3. **API key not saving**
   - Check POST request format
   - Verify authentication is working
   - Check database/storage connection

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser developer console for errors
2. Verify all endpoints return expected status codes
3. Test each endpoint individually
4. Check application logs for detailed errors
5. Verify Monday.com field type configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your hosting environment
2. **Update Monday.com field type configuration** using the provided guide
3. **Test the complete flow** in Monday.com
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues
5. **Update your automation logic** to use stored API keys
